<h1><i><u>Pet Dogs Life</u></i></h1>
<p>It was around 10 o clock in the night and it was raining cats and dogs in our street. Everyone was inside the comfort of their homes and me and my mom ran back to our house to save ourselves from getting drenched. I asked my mom to make me some hot onion pakodas. It would be like heaven to have pakodas during heavy rains. Hot pakodas on cold and rainy days are the best part of my school days. The pakodas arrived and I and my father sat on the balcony having a good conversation while eating those delicious pakodas. But there was meagre moaning somewhere near my house that we could bearly hear. My father and I got worried. We thought something might be wrong and went outside to check upon.</p>
And there he was, Raamu, my pet dog and my best friend in the whole world, abandoned by someone near the rainwater drainage pipe next to our house. I could barely see puppy as cute and innocent as Raamu, shivering and fully drenched in that cold rainy night. I felt bad for the dog and gave my pakodas and some bread to him. He ate it in a matter of just a few seconds. Then I and my father decided to take him home. We gave him good food and a hot shower and washed him with my own towel. This was 2 years back.</p>
<p>He and I always sleep together on my bed and he wakes me up before anyone else in the house
He is the reason I am active and good at exercise. He will never let me be lazy. Whenever possible, we always keep playing some or the other games with him
Whenever I fight with my parents on friends, Raamu, my pet dog will always be there with me to support me and shower unconditional love on me
He is the first person to be happy whenever I come back home from school. He will cuddle and lick all over my face and show me how much he missed me while I was gone
Ramu is not just our family member, he is the most clever member of our family. He will play games with us, keep all our family members together with his love and cuddles and also he keeps thieves and uninvited guests out of our home. My pet dog is the best thing ever that has happened to me in my life.</p>

<p>My pet dog is my best friend in the world. We sleep together, eat together, play together and also love our mom and dad together. He is not just our pet dog but my brother and an important member of my family.</p>
<p>The unconditional love and loyalty he shows to us are never seen in anybody that I know off. He is the cutest person in our family, including me, and loves to take photos with me all the time.</p>
<p>We found him near our house on the streets, on a rainy night and ever since that cold and scary night, he has been with us and has become an important part of my life. He is always the first one to greet me whenever I come back home from outside. He is a foodie who likes to eat pedigree and biscuits. He also eats curd rice sometimes. He eats three times a day with me and sleeps twice or sometimes thrice whenever he is tired after playing outside. He not only loves our family but also acts as
a guardian to our house and helps in keeping thieves and bad people away from us. My pet dog is named as Raamu and I love him very much.</p>
